# To-do

Things to be done for the site. Mostly just for personal reference.

## To update

* Vocaloid page (add new producers, update info)
* Links page (add new sites and mutuals)
* Software reccs (new software, images)

## To finish

* Asuka page
* t7s page

## To start

* Game list (for keeping track of what I've played)
* Half-Life page (my favourite video game)
* When They Cry page (faovurite VN series)

## In consideration

* Page with info on generating a site partially via script? (this is what I do to keep layout mostly consistent with minimal effort, without relying on frames or Javascript)
