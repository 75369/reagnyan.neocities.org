# Software reccomendations

Just felt like compiling a list of software that I enjoy using.

I'll try to add more suggestions as time goes on.

## Windows

**Notepad++** [(site)](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

Alternative to Windows default Notepad with theming, tabs, auto-formatting, and probably a ton more features I've never even used.

**MultiMC** [(site)](https://multimc.org/)

Alternative Minecraft client that makes it super easy to use and install mods, as well as managed isolated instances of the game. Also available for Linux.

**Windows Terminal with WSL** [(guide)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

Yep, this. If you're running Windows 10, Windows Terminal is available in the Microsoft Store and can be configured to access a Linux subsystem (ie. Ubuntu, Debian, whatever) within Windows. This is *extremely* useful for utilising Linux tools on Windows, such as ssh, tidy, ffmpeg, and others.

**Cyberduck** [(site)](https://cyberduck.io/)

My personal favourite FTP/SFTP/WebDAV/etc client for Windows. Free to use with optional licensing, it's quite modern and easy to use compared to Filezilla imo.

**Musicbee** [(site)](https://getmusicbee.com/)

Free music client with skins and add-ons available, it's still modern and easy to use. Sort of resembles iTunes?

**Mp3tag** [(site)](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/)

Music tagging software, not just for mp3 files. Supports mass-tagging and is an actual life-saver. Includes support for pulling tags from MusicBrainz as well as other sources (even custom ones such as Vocadb).
