# site archive

Last update: 10 January 2021 (images are kind of wack atm but I'll fix them eventually)

In the past, I've previously used neocities primarily for my twitter bio/about pages. However, recently I've started trying to make it more into a website to make it more fun to work with and view.

I like to save screenshots (and files if I have them) of my previous layouts so I can look back. Unfortunately I don't have all the previous revisions saved, but I do have the most recent ones!

## website

I've only recently gotten to using this Neocities as a proper... site, so not a lot to look back on so far. Previously, [feargarden](https://feargarden.neocities.org) has generally been used as more more of a formal website and thus has a bit more history in this regard.

## splash page

In late August 2019, I decided to make a splash page as it allowed me something else to customise for the main site.

The first one was made bc I like tacky site designs in a way, but I can't stand them for my actual site layout. So I decided to compromise by making my landing page tacky as hell. Since then, I've been toning it down a bit.

## about/bio pages

Before I got heavily into working with HTML/CSS I used to use premade themes (mostly from Tumblr), but at some point I decided to push myself to create my own pages as well. Everything shown here is something I've created myself (with varying degrees of success or cutting corners).

### Early 2017

These were some of my first original attempts that made heavy use of frames.

### Mid 2017

This was styled after the site [Listography](https://listography.com/), which was popular for user bios on Twitter at the time.

### July 2018

Pretty sure this was the only one that ever relied on Javascript. Despite that, it's a personal favourite of mine.

### May 2019

Styled after classic Neopets. Another favourite of mine.

### Summer 2019

Lots of experimenting with simple layouts. These ones made use of [CSS tabs](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/target.en.html) as opposed to using JS. The resource I used is bit dated (from 2003), but hey, it still works.

### August 2019

Did away tabs and unncessary info and just decided to stick to the basics.
