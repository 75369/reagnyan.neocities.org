My Neocities website!

https://reagnyan.neocities.org/

## Intro

Site is generated via `gensite.sh` -- it's kinda garbage and rudimentary but it werks, okay?

`pages/` is the home of raw pages, written in markdown. These are later converted into html by the script.

The content of `output/` is uploaded to Neocities. This contains both generated and unique pages.

## Style

`output/page.html` is (probably) a generated page. `output/folder/index.html` indicates pages with unique styles and content.
